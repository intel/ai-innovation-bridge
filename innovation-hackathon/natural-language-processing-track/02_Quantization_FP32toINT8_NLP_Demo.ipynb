    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "In a world where negativity in speech and media is prominent, humor can help uplift the human spirit. “How to create a method or model to discover the structures behind humor, recognize humor … remains a challenge because of its subjective nature” ([Jain, 2017](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234824434.pdf)). Machine learning and deep learning has been progressing to produce powerful language models. The proposed challenge here is to teach a computer how to distinguish between an humorous and non-humorous statement in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first of two Jupyter notebooks, we will train a binary text classification model to determine if a statement is humorous. For the demonstration, I will only use a small portion of the data for training. \n",
