    "Welcome to this developer-focused workshop, where we explore the integration of Intel extensions with Hugging Face models for optimized inference. The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how developers can use Intel's extensions to achieve efficient and performant inference in production applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Intel Optimizations Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of machine learning, particularly in NLP, the ability to perform efficient and speedy inference is crucial. By using the Intel extension for Transformers, we can load models directly from the Hugging Face Hub, like the \"Intel/neural-chat-7b-v1-1\" model, and optimize them for high-performance inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learning Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Optimization**: Learn how to load and optimize Hugging Face models using Intel's neural compressor and extension APIs.\n",
    "- **Streaming Output**: We'll use the TextStreamer functionality from Hugging Face Transformers to deliver a constant stream of tokens, enhancing the user experience by avoiding large text dumps.\n",
    "- **Intel's Neural Chat Model**: Explore the \"Intel/neural-chat-7b-v1-1\" model, fine-tuned on Gaudi 2 processors, to understand its capabilities in generating text based on input prompts.\n",
    "- **Practical Application**: Understand how these optimizations can be applied in real-world scenarios to deliver performant inference with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a practical understanding of how to apply Intel's optimizations to Hugging Face models for efficient inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in and explore the power of optimized model inference!\n"
