    "Welcome to this part of the workshop where we focus on sharing our work with the wider AI community. Here, we'll learn how to take a model trained using Hugging Face APIs with the Intel Extension for PyTorch and upload it to the Hugging Face Hub. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing models on platforms like Hugging Face Hub not only contributes to the open-source community but also allows for wider testing, evaluation, and improvement of models by others. This process is critical for collaborative development and advancing the field of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learning Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Upload**: We will go through the steps of uploading our trained model to the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "- **Creating a Model Card**: A model card is crucial for documenting our model. It provides information about the model's purpose, architecture, and training data, guiding other users in understanding and using the model effectively.\n",
    "- **Open Sourcing the Model**: By open-sourcing our model, we contribute to the community and enable collective advancements in AI and NLP.\n",
    "- **Evaluation on Hugging Face Hub**: We'll also look at how our model can be evaluated directly on the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Hugging Face account and a token with write permissions are necessary to upload models to the Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by setting up our environment and preparing our model for upload to the Hugging Face Hub.\n"
